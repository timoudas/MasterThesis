	abstract = {Bayesian priors are often used to restrain the otherwise highly over-parametrized vector autoregress ({VAR}) models. The currently available Bayesian {VAR} methodology does not allow the user to spec prior beliefs about the unconditional mean, or steady state, of the system. This is unfortunate as steady state is something that economists usually claim to know relatively well. This paper develops e implemented methods for analyzing both stationary and cointegrated {VARs}, in reduced or structural f with an informative prior on the steady state. We document that prior information on the steady state le to substantial gains in forecasting accuracy on Swedish macro data.

To account for the switch to an inﬂation targeting regime in 1993 we allow for a discrete break in the central bank’s instrument rule. A key equation in the model – the uncovered interest rate parity ({UIP}) condition – is well known to be rejected empirically. Therefore we explore the consequences of modifying the {UIP} condition to allow for a negative correlation between the risk premium and the expected change in the nominal exchange rate. The results show that the modiﬁcation increases the persistence in the real exchange rate and that this model has an empirical advantage compared with the standard {UIP} speciﬁcation.},

Using quarterly data from 1986Q1 to 2016Q1, this issue is analysed using Bayesian {VAR} models. Our results suggest that policy uncertainty seems to matter more than stock market volatility. Stock market volatility shocks appear to robustly have significant effects on Danish {GDP} growth. Policy uncertainty shocks, on the other hand, reliably lowers {GDP} growth in all five Nordic countries in a statistically significant manner. Statistically significant effects of policy uncertainty shocks on the Anglo-Saxon countries in our sample are harder to establish and are, in our preferred specification, only found for the United Kingdom.},

This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using ﬁrm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes ﬁrms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.},

It concludes that ﬁnancial turmoil characterized by banking distress is more likely to be associated with deeper and longer downturns than stress mainly in securities or foreign exchange markets.

We apply a Bayesian vector autoregressive model to {US} data and identify ﬁnancial shocks through a combination of narrative and shortrun sign restrictions. Our main ﬁnding is that contractionary ﬁnancial shocks temporarily increase inﬂation. This result withstands a large battery of robustness checks. Negative ﬁnancial shocks help therefore to explain why inﬂation did not drop more sharply in the aftermath of the ﬁnancial crisis. Our analysis suggests that higher borrowing costs after negative ﬁnancial shocks can account for the modest decrease in inﬂation after the ﬁnancial crisis. A policy implication is that ﬁnancial shocks act as supplytype shocks, moving output and inﬂation in opposite directions, thereby worsening the trade-oﬀ for a central bank with a dual mandate.},

	title = {Trust in Banks -  Evidence from normal times and from times of crises},
	abstract = {Trust in ﬁnancial institutions is of great importance for ﬁnancial intermediation. Against this background, we study two questions: Has trust in banks declined during the global ﬁnancial crisis and what factors determine the level of trust in banks? Employing survey evidence from Austrian households, we show that trust in banks is mainly aﬀected by “subjective” variables like the individuals’ assessment of the current economic and ﬁnancial situation and by their future outlooks. After controlling for these variables we show that the ﬁnancial crisis has caused a reduction in trust (≈ -7.5pp) which is sizable but not dramatic. Even at its lowest point (in the ﬁrst quarter of 2009) 65\% still report to have trust in the banking system, which is a higher percentage than for many other institutions. Furthermore, the drop is only slightly larger than the drop observed after a small, non-systemic crisis that occurred in 2006. Thus, the much-stressed notion of a genuine “trust crisis” is not reﬂected in our data. Finally, we provide evidence that the degree of individual information does not inﬂuence trust, that banking trust is contagious and that the extension of deposit insurance coverage in October 2008 had a positive eﬀect on trust.},

Along the way, we examine historical trends in bank capital, problems in measuring capital, and some possible unintended consequences of capital requirements. Within this framework, we evaluate how the contributions to this special issue advance the literature and suggest topics for future research.},

	abstract = {The financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis have shown that financial stress may be an important driver for economic activity. In this paper, I derive a financial stress index for Germany, using a dynamic approximate factor model that summarizes a stress component of various financial variables. Subsequently, I analyze the effects of financial stress on economic activity in a threshold vector autoregressive model. I find that if the index exceeds a certain threshold, an increase in financial stress causes economic activity to decelerate significantly, whereas if it is below this threshold, economic activity remains nearly unaffected.},

	abstract = {In this paper I study the effects of monetary policy on economic activity and asset prices in Sweden, separately identifying the effects of a conventional policy change from effects of new information about economic fundamentals. Recent research has shown that high-frequency changes in policy interest rate futures prices around central bank policy announcements might not only contain monetary policy shocks but also central bank information shocks. I add to this line of research by studying a case where the central bank, in contrast to many other central banks studied in this literature, is very open and transparent about the monetary policy decision and publishes a full set of forecasts including the interest rate at the same moment as the decision is revealed. I use this information to construct an informationally-robust instrument for monetary policy shocks as the component of high-frequency market surprises triggered by policy announcements that is orthogonal to both central bank's economic projections, including policy rate projections, and to past market surprises. I also add sign restrictions on stock market changes around the announcement to separate structural monetary policy shock from central bank information shocks. In contrast to recent work for other countries, I do not find that separating monetary policy shocks from central bank information shocks is important to measure the effects of monetary policy in Sweden.},
